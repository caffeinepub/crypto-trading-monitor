On each price polling cycle, for every open AI trade with status 'Open', run detectReversal from marketReversalDetector.ts. Based on the returned ReversalSignal: (1) If recommendedAction is 'close' — immediately set trade status to 'SL Hit' (closed by reversal protection), record the exit at current price in AI trade history with a note 'Closed by reversal detection', and trigger auto-regeneration for that modality. (2) If recommendedAction is 'reverse' and the trade has passed TP1 (tp1Executed is true) — close the current trade at current price with profit recorded, then queue a new trade for that modality in the opposite direction. (3) If recommendedAction is 'tighten_sl' — update the trade's effectiveSL to the suggestedNewSL value and set profitProtectionSL accordingly, and persist to localStorage. Update the stored trade in localStorage under 'ai_daily_trades' after each action.",
