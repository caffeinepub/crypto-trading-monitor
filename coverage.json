        "summary": "Audit and fix the TP/SL order execution logic in useAITradeMonitoring.ts so that when a live AI trade's price crosses TP1, TP2, TP3, or the effective stop-loss, the corresponding real Binance order actions are triggered. Specifically: (1) When TP1 is crossed and tp1Executed is false — mark tp1Executed = true, cancel the original STOP_MARKET order via cancelOrder(), place a new STOP_MARKET at the entry price (breakeven), and persist the updated effectiveSL and riskManagementStep ('breakeven') to localStorage under 'ai_daily_trades'. (2) When TP2 is crossed and tp2Executed is false — mark tp2Executed = true, cancel the current STOP_MARKET order, place a new STOP_MARKET at the TP1 price (trailing), and persist effectiveSL and riskManagementStep ('trailing'). (3) When TP3 is crossed and tp3Executed is false — mark tp3Executed = true, place a MARKET close order for the full position quantity on the opposite side, record the closed trade in AI trade history with full TP3 profit, set status to 'TP Hit', and trigger auto-regeneration for that modality. (4) When the effective SL is crossed — place a MARKET close order on the opposite side, record the trade as 'SL Hit' in history, and trigger auto-regeneration. All Binance order calls must use binanceOrderService.ts and only fire when BOTH isLiveTradingEnabled() returns true AND getModalityLiveOrders()[trade.modality] is true. Each call must be individually wrapped in try/catch with a 10-second Promise.race timeout. If an order call fails, log the error, show a toast (e.g., 'TP1 order update failed — SL not moved to breakeven'), and continue updating the local trade state regardless.",

(2) Regardless of live trading mode, update the position's stored TP level(s) in localStorage (under the 'positions' key) with the newly accepted TP price, so the PositionCard and PositionDashboard reflect the updated target immediately. (3) Record the accepted suggestion in the adjustment history stored in localStorage (using the existing AdjustmentHistoryRecord type from frontend/src/types/adjustment.ts) with outcome 'accepted'.

(2) Ensure the 'Accept' and 'Reject' (or 'Dismiss') buttons inside AdjustmentSuggestionCard call these props when clicked, with the suggestion object passed as the argument. (3) If the component currently uses a local dismiss-only state without calling onAccept, refactor it so that the parent (AIInsightsTab) controls the accepted/dismissed state via the callbacks and removes the suggestion from its rendered list on both accept and dismiss.
