        "summary": "Update the asset selection input in the PositionSizeCalculator component (frontend/src/components/PositionSizeCalculator.tsx) to populate its dropdown/autocomplete with the full list of Binance USD-M Futures perpetual pairs fetched via the existing useBinancePairs hook (frontend/src/hooks/useBinancePairs.ts), which calls https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/exchangeInfo and filters for contractType === 'PERPETUAL'. The selector must expose all perpetual pairs returned by that endpoint — not a hardcoded or pre-filtered subset. Display a loading state while pairs are being fetched and an error message if the fetch fails. The selected symbol must drive the live price fetch (https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/ticker/price?symbol=SYMBOL) and leverage bracket fetch (https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/leverageBracket?symbol=SYMBOL) already implemented in the component.",
