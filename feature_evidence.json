If credentials are found, automatically trigger an import of the user's open positions from Binance USD-M Futures (via binancePositionService.ts / the existing getOpenPositions function) and merge them into the positions list managed by usePositionStorage, skipping any symbol already tracked. Display a non-blocking toast notification indicating how many positions were imported (e.g., 'Auto-imported 3 positions from Binance') or an error message if the import fails.
