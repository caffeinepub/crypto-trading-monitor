Audit the polling mechanism inside AIDailyTradesSection: ensure the price fetch completes and returns a non-zero, non-undefined value before buildng the enriched trade objects passed to AITradeCard. If the price is still loading (0 or undefined), pass a loading flag to AITradeCard instead of a zero price so PnL is not computed with an invalid baseline.",
