      "featureTitle": "Fix the Live Trading mode toggle in LiveTradingToggle.tsx and useLiveTradingMode.ts so that enabling it does not cause the application to freeze or become unresponsive. The freeze likely originates from a synchronous blocking operation, an infinite re-render loop triggered by state changes when live trading is activated, or an unhandled promise rejection in the order placement flow that locks the UI. Audit the toggle activation path — including the confirmation dialog, credential validation, localStorage write, and any reactive effects that fire on live trading state change — and ensure all async operations are non-blocking with proper error boundaries.",
