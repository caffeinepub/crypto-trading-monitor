  "summary": "The implementation adds comprehensive AI market analysis and risk management tools including sentiment analysis, trend prediction, TP/SL adjustment suggestions, position size calculator, portfolio exposure visualization, and scenario simulator. All features are frontend-only using Binance API data with golden-themed UI integration. However, some acceptance criteria require verification for completeness, particularly around automatic updates, prediction accuracy tracking, and adjustment history.",

      "reason": "While useSentimentAnalysis.ts implements refetchInterval: 30000, there's no evidence in the diff that the SentimentGauge component is mounted in a context where it receives automatic updates across all traded assets.
