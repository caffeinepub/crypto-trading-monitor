  "summary": "The diff modifies AIDailyTradesSection.tsx, AIDailyTradesSummary.tsx, and AITradeCard.tsx to address REQ-133 and REQ-134. REQ-133 is largely addressed: prices are fetched via fetchCurrentPrices before building enriched trade objects, a pricesLoading flag is used, and polling appears to be implemented. REQ-134 is partially addressed in AITradeCard.tsx with a priceLoading prop and guards, and AIDailyTradesSummary correctly filters trades with valid prices. However, REQ-135 (deduplication in useAITradeGeneration.ts and useAITradeStorage.ts) shows no evidence of changes in the diff.",

      "requirement": "Fix the duplicate 'Day Trading' modality card by auditing useAITradeGeneration.ts and useAITradeStorage.ts to ensure exactly four unique modality trades are stored and rendered. Add deduplication guard in storage write path and remove duplicate localStorage entries on load.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any modifications to useAITradeGeneration.ts or useAITradeStorage.ts. No deduplication logic or guard against duplicate modality entries in the storage write path is evidenced in the changed files.",
