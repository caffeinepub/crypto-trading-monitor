  "summary": "The diff implements most of REQ-36: InstallButton.tsx is updated to always be visible (unless already installed), uses usePWAInstall hook for native prompt, and falls back to a new InstallInstructionsModal with browser-specific step-by-step instructions for Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox. The button uses the golden theme. One acceptance criterion has a gap: the button still conditionally returns null when isInstalled is true, but the core requirement about not hiding when the install prompt is unavailable is satisfied.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-36",
      "requirement": "The existing InstallButton.tsx component is updated or replaced so that it no longer conditionally hides itself when the install prompt is unavailable.",
      "reason": "The updated InstallButton.tsx still returns null when isInstalled is true. The AC states the button should be 'always visible in the app header regardless of browser PWA support'. In standalone/installed mode the button is hidden entirely, which may conflict with the always-visible requirement.",
