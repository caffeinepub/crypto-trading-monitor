  "summary": "The diff implements a tab-based navigation system for the app with four tabs (Dashboard, AI Daily Trades, AI Insights, Risk Management). Most requirements are well-addressed. Key gaps include: the AIDailyTradesSummary component is missing from the AI Daily Trades tab (REQ-42 AC), and the TotalCapitalSummary is moved into the Dashboard tab rather than remaining in the header across all tabs (REQ-40 AC mentions capital summary remains visible regardless of active tab).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-42",
      "requirement": "AI Daily Trades tab should display the AIDailyTradesSummary header/banner showing total AI portfolio PnL, in addition to AIDailyTradesSection.",
      "reason": "AIDailyTradesTab.tsx only renders AIDailyTradesSection and does not import or render AIDailyTradesSummary. The AC explicitly requires the AIDailyTradesSummary component showing total AI portfolio PnL.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-40",
      "requirement": "The app header (logo, install button, capital summary) remains visible regardless of active tab.",
      "reason": "TotalCapitalSummary is placed inside DashboardTab, meaning it is only visible on the Dashboard tab and not persistent in the header across all tabs. The AC states capital summary should remain visible regardless of active tab.",
